Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Northwest University and my Master‚Äôs degree from Wuhan University. I am grateful for the guidance provided by my Master‚Äôs supervisor, Prof.¬†Yuling Jiao.\nMy current research interests lie in statistical learning and deep learning theory, particularly in deep representation learning, self-supervised learning, and the theoretical foundations for large language models (LLMs). I focus on establishing theoretical understandings and developing novel approaches in these areas.\nIf you are interested in my work, please feel free to contact me at vincen.nwu@gmail.com.\n\n\nAll publications listed have authors arranged in alphabetical order.\n\n1. Unsupervised Transfer Learning via Adversarial Contrastive Training\nChenguang Duan, Yuling Jiao, Huazhen Lin, Wensen Ma, Jerry Zhijian Yang\n[arXiv] | [openview] | [code]\n\n\n2. Distribution Matching for Self-Supervised Transfer Learning\nYuling Jiao, Wensen Ma, Defeng Sun, Hansheng Wang, Yang Wang\n[arXiv] | [code]\n\n\n\n\n\nmlimpl is an open-source machine learning implementation library designed for research and engineering. It features concise implementations of popular algorithms with a focus on code readability and modular design, making it easy for users to understand and extend. Ideal for teaching, prototyping, and reproducible research. The project is actively maintained and welcomes contributions and discussions.\n‚≠ê Stars: 550+ | üç¥ Forks: 130+ (as of July 2025)"
